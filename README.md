# StatBoard

A slideshow which displays statistics about an office or company. The StatBoard was designed to be displayed on a television in a common area in the office so that staff can see cool inforation at a glance. It's useful for highlighting office events, competitions, anniversaries, weather, even communiting information. The slides which have been developed so far:

- Advent of Code Leaderboard
- Clients
- Office Competitions
- Upcoming Corporate Events
- Coffee Machine Counter
- Fantasy Football Matchups
- March Madness Bracket Challenge
- Metro Commuting Information
- Pet of the Month
- Staff Anniversaries and Birthdays
- Office Weather
- Countdown to a Big Event

Along with the slideshow, the same application also houses an Admin Panel interface that allows users to modify some of the information which is displayed in the slides.

## Backend

This repository holds only the slideshow code, written as a React application. There is also a backend RESTful API which serves all of the data seen in the slides. The API is written in Goland, and is housed in a seperate repository.
